# Neural Style Transfer
This project is an implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST) using Tensforflow. A pretrained VGG-19 model was used to extract 
the features of the content and style image. The extracted features were iteratively merged to create a combined photo where the 
content image has been recreated in the style of the style image.
The algorithm ran for 2000 iterations and took about 90 minutes to finish.
